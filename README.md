# ACM - Mushroom Classification 

## Langauge

My code is completed in Python. It may not run entirely, mainly at the end with the prediction model, however, I am able to see trends in the correlation of mushroom characteristics. 

## Explanation
I researched into how how swift runs alongside the sentimentScore theme, it is declared in line 20. The theme does a majority of the calculations to determine the score! Most of my explanations are in the actual code, located in main.swift.
